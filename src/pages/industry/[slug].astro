We focus on neighborhood-specific content, local expertise, and personalized service positioning that portals can\'t match. Local buyers and sellers often prefer working with true local experts.' },
      { question: 'Should I focus on SEO for buyers or sellers?', answer: 'Both. We create content strategies targeting buyer searches (home listings, neighborhood info) and seller searches (home values, selling guides). This builds a balanced lead pipeline for your business.' },

While hospital systems have brand recognition, independent practices can win on local searches, personalized care positioning, and specialty expertise.
